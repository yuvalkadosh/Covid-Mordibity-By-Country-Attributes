# Covid-Mordibity-By-Country-Attributes
Can we predict high morbidity of covid-19 by country attributes?

In the research we tried to find a connection between the main attributes of a country to the covid morbidity.
We crawled to a few sites, to collect different interesting attributes for all the countries and we used the positive tests rate to measure the morbidity, calculated by dividing the total covid cases amount in the country by the total amount of covid tests made.
We checked the relation of each attribute with the positive tests rate and created a linear regression model to predict the positive tests rate in a country by the data we crawled.
